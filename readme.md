The Idea Spinner is an application design to help you quickly generate prompts for any defined creative activity or endeavor.

*Currently it's set to only demo board game prompts - feel free to fork and modify the [demo.json](./apps/web/src/store/demo.json).*

## quick start

```sh
# download the workspace
git clone https://github.com/daniellacosse/idea-spinner.git
cd idea-spinner

# link dependencies
yarn

# start the dev server
yarn watch
```

## high-level tour

### devtools

Idea Spinner is a [yarn workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces/#gatsby-focus-wrapper) that is set up to developed directly off main. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) runs the linter and test suite before deploying to production. If you'd like to contribute, you're welcome to reach out to any of our contributors to set up a pair-programming session.

Documentation is generated by [typedoc](https://typedoc.org) on commit and loaded into the storybook (which should open when you run `yarn watch`). [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) ensures a minimum amount of documentation coverage is written during development.

You can find a list of all the defined `yarn` scripts you can run [here](https://github.com/daniellacosse/idea-spinner/blob/main/package.json#L40).

### folder structure

The source code is organized into two top level directories:
- `/apps` are platform-specific services, meant to be deployed for direct use by an end-user
- `/packages` are resuable javascript modules that should avoid any platform-specific APIs

Generally you should use folders to co-locate and nest dependencies. For example:

```sh
/packages
  /spinner
    /Spinner
      index.ts # business logic and module definition
      test.ts # unit tests
      /ShuffleQueue #  submodule Spinner depends on
```

## setting up VSCode
Given the nascency of the vue3 and yarn3 ecosystems, VSCode support is currently in flux and not fully complete. For now:

1. Install the recommended plugins by clicking on the `Extensions` icon, typing `@recommended`, and then clicking the `Install` button on those that are still available.
2. Review the `.vscode/settings.example.json`. If this looks good to you, you can activate it by running `cp .vscode/settings.example.json .vscode/settings.json`
3. Confirm that TS in the bottom-bar is set to our SDK. You can click on it to change.
